# An-unsupervised-framework-based-on-DDCL-and-TJAS-for-early-fault-detection-of-bearing
Welcome to the official implementation of the paper "An Unsupervised Framework Based on Dual Domain Contrastive Learning and Tri-Indicator Joint Alarm Strategy for Early Fault Detection of Bearing," published in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (IEEE TIM).
# Overview
This repository contains the experimental code associated with our paper. The framework we propose is an innovative approach to early fault detection in bearings, utilizing dual domain contrastive learning and a tri-indicator joint alarm strategy. Our method is unsupervised, making it robust and efficient for real-world applications.

# Getting Started
